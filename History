            <h2>Ancient History</h2>
            <p>
              The history of Greece encompasses the history of the territory of
              the modern nation-state of Greece as well as that of the Greek
              people and the areas they inhabited and ruled historically. The
              scope of Greek habitation and rule has varied throughout the ages
              and as a result, the history of Greece is similarly elastic in
              what it includes. Generally, the history of Greece is divided into
              the following periods: Paleolithic Greece, starting c. 3.3 million
              years ago and ending in 20000 BC. Significant geomorphological and
              climatic changes occurred in the modern Greek area which were
              definitive for the development of fauna and flora and the survival
              of Homo sapiens in the region. Mesolithic Greece, starting in
              13000 BC and ending around 7000 BC, was a period of long and slow
              development of primitive human "proto-communities". Neolithic
              Greece, beginning with the establishment of agricultural societies
              around 7000 BC and ending c. 3200 – c. 3100 BC, was a vital part
              of the early history of Greece because it was the base for early
              Bronze Age civilizations in the area. The first organized
              communities developed and basic art became more advanced in
              Neolithic Greece. Bronze Age Greece (c. 3200 – c. 1100 BC) began
              with the transition to a metal-based economy during the Early
              Helladic period of mainland Greece (c. 3200 – c. 2000 BC).
              Meanwhile, Cycladic culture prospered in the Cyclades (c. 3200 –
              c. 1050 BC) and Minoan civilization around Crete (c. 3500 –
              c. 1100 BC). The Bronze Age ended with the rise and fall of the
              Mycenaean Greek palace culture (c. 1750 – c. 1050 BC) in the Late
              Bronze Age collapse.

            <h2>Prehistoric Greece</h2>
            <p>
              Fossils of one of the earliest pre-humans (Ouranopithecus
              macedoniensis, 9.6–8.7 million years ago), and of quite possibly
              the oldest direct ancestor of all humans (Graecopithecus, 7.2
              million years ago) were found in Greece. In addition, 5.7 million
              year old footprints were found on the Greek island of Crete, which
              may suggest hominin evolution outside of Africa, contrary to
              current hypotheses. The Paleolithic period is generally
              understudied in Greece because research has traditionally focused
              on the later parts of prehistory (Neolithic, Bronze Age) and the
              Classical times. Nevertheless, significant advances have been
              achieved over recent years, and the archaeological record has been
              enriched with new material, collected mostly in the framework of
              regional surveys but also through systematic or rescue
              excavations. New caves and rock shelters, as well as recently
              discovered and important open-air sites are now being excavated.
              The earliest traces of human habitation in present-day Greece were
              discovered at Petralona Cave in Chalkidiki, Macedonia and date
              back 1 million years.

            <h2>Roman Greece</h2>
            <p>
              In the 2nd century BC, Greece was conquered by the Roman Republic
              and came under its control. Still, Greek culture flourished during
              this period city states maintained a level of political autonomy,
              and Roman society adopted many aspects of Greek culture. For
              example, Roman poets like Ovid, Virgil, and Horace retold and
              adopted many Greek myths of old, folding them into Roman culture.
              Roman society even claimed to share a cultural lineage with
              Greece, as exemplified by Virgil's epic, the Aeneid, which details
              their founding myth of how the Roman people descended from the
              Trojan Aeneas of Homeric lore. Although the period of Roman rule
              in Greece is conventionally dated as starting from the sacking of
              Corinth by the Roman Lucius Mummius in 146 BC, Macedonia had
              already come under Roman control with the defeat of its king,
              Perseus, by the Roman Aemilius Paullus at Pydna in 168 BC. The
              Romans divided the region into four smaller republics, and in 146
              BC Macedonia officially became a province, with its capital at
              Thessalonica. The rest of the Greek city-states eventually paid
              homage to Rome, ending their de jure autonomy as well. The Romans
              left local administration to the Greeks without making any attempt
              to abolish traditional political patterns. The agora in Athens
              continued to be the center of civic and political life. Emperor
              Caracalla's decree in 212 AD, the Constitutio Antoniniana,
              extended citizenship outside Italy to all free adult men in the
              entire Roman Empire, effectively raising provincial populations to
              equal status with the city of Rome itself. The importance of this
              decree is historical, not political. It set the basis for
              integration, where the economic and judicial mechanisms of the
              state could be applied throughout the Mediterranean as was once
              done from Latium into all Italy. In practice, integration did not
              take place uniformly. Societies already integrated with Rome, such
              as Greece, were favored by the decree, as opposed to the further
              away, poorer, or more culturally different provinces like Britain,
              Palestine, or Egypt. Caracalla's decree did not set in motion the
              processes that led to the transfer of power from Italy and the
              West to Greece and the East, but rather accelerated them, setting
              the foundations for the millennium-long rise of Greece, in the
              form of the Eastern Roman Empire, as a major power in Europe and
              the Mediterranean in the Middle Ages.

              <h2>Alexander the Great</h2>
              <p>
                He was born in 356 BCE at Pella in Macedonia, the son of Philip
                II and Olympias (daughter of King Neoptolemus of Epirus). From
                age 13 to 16 he was taught by Aristotle, who inspired him with
                an interest in philosophy, medicine, and scientific
                investigation, but he was later to advance beyond his teacher’s
                narrow precept that non-Greeks should be treated as slaves. Left
                in charge of Macedonia in 340 during Philip’s attack on
                Byzantium, Alexander defeated the Maedi, a Thracian people. Two
                years later he commanded the left wing at the Battle of
                Chaeronea, in which Philip defeated the allied Greek states, and
                displayed personal courage in breaking the Sacred Band of
                Thebes, an elite military corps composed of 150 pairs of lovers.
                A year later Philip divorced Olympias, and, after a quarrel at a
                feast held to celebrate his father’s new marriage, Alexander and
                his mother fled to Epirus, and Alexander later went to Illyria.
                Shortly afterward, father and son were reconciled and Alexander
                returned, but his position as heir was jeopardized.
