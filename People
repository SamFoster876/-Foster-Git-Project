              The current population of Greece is a little over 10 million, but
              slowly, the overall population is declining. After hitting a peak
              of 11.1 million in 2010, and slowly ever since, the population has
              been declining every year. This is likely due to the fertility
              rate in Greece greatly decreasing as well. It's projected that the
              population will be down to 6 million by the end of the century.

              The main Ethnic Groups in Greece are Hellenes also known as
              Greeks, Turks, Albanians, and Bulgarians. However the Hellenes
              make up over 90% of the population. Back in the 4th Century BC,
              Greece was invaded by many different groups of Crusaders, and out
              of those groups, the Slavs created homes and villages in Greece,
              intending to stay forever. However, by the 9th Century BC, most of
              the Slavs had left, leaving only a few to stay. This is when the
              Turks and Albanians arrived to Greece.

              The rest of the population primarily are Atheist or Muslim. In the
              past, almost everyone in Greece used to believe in a very
              different religion. They were polytheistic, meaning they believed
              in many Gods and Goddesses with many stories surrounding these
              supernatural beings and the creation of the Universe.
