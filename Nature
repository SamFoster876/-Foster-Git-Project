              <p>
                Greece is home to various forests, including those in the Pindus
                mountain range and the Peloponnese region. The Foloi oak forest
                (aka natural wonder) is the only one in the Balkan area, and one
                of the largest, and oldest, in Europe. This national treasure is
                located at the southern foot of the Erymanthos mountain range,
                about 25 kilometres from Ancient Olympia and three hours from
                Athens.

                While Greece is not known for extensive river systems, notable
                rivers include Aliakmonas, Axios, and Struma in the north, and
                the Evros River along the border with Turkey The longest flowing
                rivers in Greece are Evros and Axios. However, they both
                originate from neighboring countries and empty in the Greek sea.
                The longest river that has its springs in the country is
                Aliakmon River, which flows through western Macedonia. Apart
                from some sections of Rivers Evros and Loudias, the rest are not
                navigable due to the rush of the waters..

                <p>
                  Greece is characterized by mountainous terrain. The Pindus
                  mountain range and Mount Olympus, the highest peak, are
                  prominent features Mount Olympus in Macedonia is the highest
                  mountain in Greece, reaching a height of 2,917 m (Mytikas
                  peak). Olympus is world-famous as the home of the Greek gods.
                  This is why they were also called the Olympian Gods. About 40
                  mountain ranges in Greece exceed the elevation of 2,000 m,
                  including: Mounts Smolikas (2637m), Kaimaktsalan (2524m),
                  Gramos (2520m), Giona (2510m), Parnassus (2457m), Psiloritis

                  desert in Greece, some say also in Europe. The climate is
                  generally Mediterranean, with arid conditions in coastal
                  areas.

            <p>
              Greece has a diverse climate with a predominant Mediterranean
              pattern, featuring hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The
              country is also influenced by winds, including the Meltemi in the
              Aegean Sea during the summer.The mean temperature during summer
              (April to September) is approximately 24°C in Athens and southern
              Greece, while lower in the north. Generally, temperatures are
              higher in the southern part of the country. Except for a few
              thunderstorms, rainfall is rare from June to August, where sunny
              and dry days are mainly observed. The dry, hot weather is often
              relieved by a system of seasonal breezes.
